            Chapter Title: About Me
        </h2>
        <p class="intro">
            I am a 36-year-old woman from many places, but mainly small-town Florida and the DC metro area. 
            My father was in the Army while I was growing up, so I moved around numerous times, which is 
            why it's a little difficult to pin down "home."
            I went to college to be a math teacher, but found it too difficult to manage a classroom, 
            so I ended up joining the military.
            At first I recruited with the Army, but my dad told me that it would be better to join the 
            Air Force, and ultimately that's what I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Air Force, I trained to become an airborne Korean linguist. 
            I met my husband because we (entirely coincidentally) joined on the same day, went through 
            basic training at the same time, and both ended up going to Monterey, California, to learn 
            a language for our airborne linguist career field, although he learned Arabic instead of Korean. 
            We dated throughout the 1.5-year language school, experienced six months of long distance when 
            I moved on to our next training location before he did, and ended up getting married just a week 
            or two before he moved on to that training location. We've been married for over six years now.
        </p>
        <p>
            More recently, my husband and I were both selected to retrain into the Cyber Warfare career field 
            within the Air Force, so that is what we've been doing. It is another long training pipeline; we've 
            been at it for about a year and a half now and still have almost a full year left if all goes smoothly. 
            <span class="sentence">On a more personal level, we have two German Shepherds and an unreasonably large 
            board game collection.</span> I like to read and go indoor bouldering. When all my creative energy 
            isn't eaten up by programming and cyber-related pursuits, I also like to write.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the retrain into Cyber Warfare and the pursuit of this degree program are relatively recent 
            developments in my life, I have been interested in this sort of thing since I learned basic HTML and 
            CSS from the Neopets pet pages when I was in middle school. I have created multiple blog-style personal 
            websites over the years, and also created and administered several online communities. I'm pretty good 
            at googling my way to most things I want to do with a website, but it will be nice to tackle it in a 
            more methodical way through this course.
