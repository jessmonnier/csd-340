            Assignment 9.3 – JavaScript - Part 1
        </h1>
        <p>
            The following flash fiction story is something I wrote in 2016 for a challenge on a writing 
            website. I repurposed it for this assignment because it's pretty short so I figured it would work.
        </p>
        <div id="story">
        <h2>
            Seafaring
        </h2>
            <p>
                "She's seafaring," the captain promised before he brought the siblings on board. This in 
                response to the skeptical expression Samael wore as his stare swept the ship from bow to stern.
            </p>
            <p>
                But beggars can't be choosers, and they could afford none of the other ships at anchor. Samael's 
                uncertainty was soft and tremulous, but his fear for Tabitha was bright and sharp and his 
                determination was as unyielding as <span class="blank" id="granite">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now she feels his frustration and terror, amplified through the squeeze of his hand around hers, 
                and nausea as the ship swells and rolls beneath them. But Samael's presence is swallowed by the feel 
                of the ship buckling in the grip of the storm that rages. She is the ship, every straining board, 
                the rigging whipping against the deck and the mast, even the crew — most of them hunkered down against 
                the wind, but a few still fighting for control against the 
                <span class="blank" id="indifferent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> destructive force of the storm. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying to hold it all together is a hundred times harder than trying to remain curled tightly around 
                herself against the prying, pulling hands of the wardens who strapped her down for her <i>treatments</i> before 
                Samael freed her. She could never do it. They were too strong. And the storm is beyond the strength of mere 
                men.
            </p>
            <p>
                But she must, she must — alone, the ship would have been torn apart already, all thirty-three souls on 
                board lost to the sea. Together they are <span class="blank" id="stronger">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>. 
                Maybe they can accomplish together what Tabitha was too weak to do alone. She holds on. The wind howls and the 
                water chops and crashes, stealing away the voices of the crew — drowning out Samael's broken murmuring 
                of "Bitty, Bitty… Tabitha… It's okay" as his fingers tense in her hair — but Tabitha hears it all as if it 
                is spoken in her own voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually the storm eases, and Tabitha leaks back into her body to find herself diminished. She fights for 
                breath against a chest that is suddenly heavy. Her muscles are liquid, her skin at once cold and hot, and 
                chills set her to shaking that aches in her bones. She slits her eyes toward Samael and tries his name, but 
                her throat squeezes it into a moan.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Bitty," Samael murmurs, his dark eyes flicking over her face. "Where did you go?"
            </p>
            <p>
                She doesn't need to answer. She senses his understanding — a soft feeling under the 
                <span class="blank" id="pang">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> of despair. <i>I was the ship,</i> she wants to say. 
                <i>We were strong.</i> But that strength has gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                His fingers thread through her hair. "I wanted to keep you safe. I thought I could — I thought this was the way."
            </p>
            <p>
                Her eyes slip closed, but she fights for a smile. She manages a bare whisper. "S'okay." She may yet survive this; 
                she's not sure. But if not, better to die <span class="blank" id="madlibs">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>, having 
                felt the strength to withstand a storm, than in captivity.
